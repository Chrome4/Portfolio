# Portfolio
This is my portfolio project for week 2 of the boot camp. 

#### Please note:
1. I have included my wireframe for this project. You'll see my original idea and how it's slighty different to the end-result because I did not see   that I needed to have at least one "Work card", bigger than the others.

2. Also please know that I do not yet have any working or current applications to showcase for this assignment. 

3. I also choose to leave out the section with a resume because I do not currently have one to link to this project or one worth showing yet. 

4. Please disregard the reset.css as I thought I would need it but I did not use it. I left it in to show that I know how to create and link it.

5. The folder labeled "week2-hw-code-snippets" is the code my instructor provided the class. I did not reference it until after I was "done" with the assignment.
